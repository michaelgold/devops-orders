Orders microservice


## How to run the code

The `Orders` APP has already been deployed to Bluemix, so 
directly visit [this link](https://nyu-order-service-f18.mybluemix.net/) to use the APP.


If everything works fine, you'll see the APP's beautiful homepage.


## Create a new order
Just fill the table entries and click `Create` button.


And if everything works fine, an Order will be created.


## List all orders
Use this link:
`https://nyu-order-service-f18.mybluemix.net/orders`

## Run unit tests
Bluemix is taking care of unit tests in its devops toolchain and pipeline.
Each github submission will trigger the pipeline.
